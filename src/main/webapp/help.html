    Configure build promotions.
  <p>
    The notion of build promotion is a mechanism that lets you differenciate good builds
    from bad builds. It is also often used for throttling changes that the downstream sees
    &mdash; for example, let's say your builds are going through QA and performance
    testing, each of which takes 3 hours to run. If you let them pick up the last successful
    build while your project is producing a new build every 15 mins, then chances are those
    two downstream efforts will pick up different versions of your build. This problem
    is particularly evident when downstream efforts involve human activities. They can get
    overwhelmed if you are building too frequently.

    By promoting builds selectively, you can make sure the downstream efforts are concentrated
    on smaller number of builds.
  <p>
    Build promotion configuration consists of three things:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Name</b> of the promotion criterion. This is primarily for humans for easier identification
      of multiple promotion criteria.
    <li>
      <b>Conditions</b> that determine when a build is promoted. If multiple
      conditions are specified, all of them must be met for a build to be promoted.
    <li>
      <b>Actions</b> that determine what happens when a build is promoted.
  </ul>

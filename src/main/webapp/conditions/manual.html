<div>
    Designates that this promotion happens only when someone goes to the Hudson web UI
    and click the "force promotion" button. This is useful when the promotion process
    is controlled by humans (such as by voting), or when you'd like to temporarily suspend
    promotion (such as when you are nearing a release.)
